We are passionate about sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ with people from all walks of life, both locally and globally. We have various outreach programs that aim to meet the spiritual, physical, and social needs of our communities, such as food banks, health clinics, education workshops, and disaster relief. Through these programs, we seek to demonstrate Godâ€™s love, compassion, and power to those who are in need of his grace. We also partner with other churches and organizations to support missions and social justice efforts around the world. We invite you to join us in our outreach ministry, as we strive to make a positive difference in the world for the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p></div>
