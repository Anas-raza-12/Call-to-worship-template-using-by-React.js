          <h3>STATEMENT OF FAITH</h3>
          <h1>WHAT WE “BELIEVE” IN</h1>
          <p>
            One God We believe in One, True and Loving God who has revealed
            Himself in the Bible as One Being in three distinct persons – God
            the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, who is eternal,
            self-existent and self-sufficient; Creator, Provider and Preserver
            of all things visible and invisible.
          </p>
          <p>The Lord Jesus Christ – God in Flesh</p>
          <p>
            We believe in Jesus Christ, the second Person of the Holy Trinity,
            the only begotten Son of God, the Father, His divinity, His
            humanity, His virgin birth by the power of the Holy Spirit, His
            sinless, holy life, His Words and His Blood shed for our salvation,
            His miracles, healings, signs, wonders, suffering, death on the
            cross and His bodily resurrection from the dead, His ascension to
            the Father in heaven. We believe He, in all glory is seated at the
            right hand of the Father. He is our one and only mediator and
            interceding High Priest forever.

                We believe in the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Triune
                Godhead, who proceeds from the Father and the Son; to lead us
                and guide us in all truth, love and power.

                Testament and the New Testament (consisting of 66 books) in
                their original script is the only infallible, inerrant,
                authoritative, and living Word written under the inspiration of
                the Holy Spirit.

              <p>
                {" "}
                The Fall of ManWe believe that man was made in the image and
                likeness of God with a free will to respond to God his Creator,
                but he willfully disobeyed God’s Word, and hence, was separated

                grace and mercy of God, we are saved through faith in Christ
                Jesus. We believe that everyone who repents of his or her sins,
                believes in the salvation words and deeds of Jesus Christ, is
                born again, and is made alive by the in-dwelling presence and
                power of the Holy Spirit.

                We believe that forgiveness and remission of sins for the whole
                world is by and through the blood of Jesus Christ: the eternal
                High Priest who offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice of
                atonement for the sins of the world, once and for all, and sat
                at the right hand of the Father.

            reverence. We stand on the promises of Your Word, knowing that every
            word spoken is true and unchanging. Your promises are our
            foundation, our strength, and our hope. Lord, as we gather on this
            website seeking Your presence, we invite the fire of the Holy Spirit
            to consume us, ignite our faith, and illuminate our hearts.
          </p>
          <p>
            We declare the promises of Psalm 119:105, that Your Word is a lamp
            to our feet and a light to our path. In the journey of life, guide
            us, Lord, that we may walk in the radiance of Your truth. May the
            promises of Psalm 23 comfort us, knowing that You are our shepherd,
            and in You, we lack nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Father, we stand on the promise of Jeremiah 29:11, that You have
            plans to prosper us and not to harm us, plans to give us hope and a
            future. We trust in Your divine plan, and we surrender our lives to

            testament to Your mighty works.

            renew our strength, O Lord. May our hope in You be a testimony to
            Your faithfulness.In moments of weakness, we hold onto the promise
            of 2 Corinthians 12:9, that Your grace is sufficient for us, and
            Your power is made perfect in weakness. Empower us, O God, with Your
            grace, and let Your strength be displayed in our lives.

            Kingdom. Let the flame of Your Spirit refine us, shaping us into
